## Detailed Test Results

### RFC-001: Workspace Path Resolution Utility

#### Test 2.1.1: Regular Directory Path Resolution
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```
Input: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx
Output: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx
Expected: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx
Match: true
```

#### Test 2.1.2: Symlinked Ghost Workspace Resolution
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```
Symlink: /tmp/ocx-ghost-test-1768853103
Resolved to: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx
Expected: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx
Match: true
```

#### Test 2.1.3: Broken Symlink Error Handling
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```
Broken link: /tmp/broken-test-1768853111
Error name: WorkspaceError
Error code: ENOENT
Error message: Path does not exist: /tmp/broken-test-1768853111
Clear message: true
```

**Observations**:
- Error handling is excellent
- Error messages are actionable
- Error codes are correct (ENOENT for missing paths)

#### Test 2.2.1: getWorkspaceInfo() for Symlink
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```json
{
  "symlink": "/tmp/ocx-ghost-test-1768853120",
  "real": "/Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx",
  "isSymlink": true,
  "resolvedAt": "2026-01-19T20:05:20.967Z"
}
```

All fields populated correctly.

#### Test 2.2.2: getWorkspaceInfo() for Regular Directory
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```json
{
  "symlink": null,
  "real": "/Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx",
  "isSymlink": false,
  "resolvedAt": "2026-01-19T20:05:28.708Z"
}
```

Correctly identifies non-symlink with `symlink: null`.

#### Test 2.2.3: isSymlink() Detection
**Status**: ✅ PASS

```
Symlink path: /tmp/ocx-ghost-test-1768853136 → true
Regular path: /Users/chili/•KOKPIT•/•PROGRAMOWANIE•/chili-ocx → false
```

Perfect boolean detection.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
✅ **MERGE TO MAIN**

All critical functionality is working correctly. The branch is ready for production use.

### Post-Merge Actions

1. **Update Production Ghost Profile**
   - Switch production users to the new registry
   - Monitor for any unexpected issues

2. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Tag: `v1.1.0` (state.json version)
   - Release notes: Include RFC-001, RFC-002, RFC-003 summaries

3. **Address Remaining Issues from Notepad**
   - Seed write permissions (allow saving PRDs/RFCs directly)
   - Sprout write permissions (allow saving execution plans directly)
   - Git workflow documentation
   - State management & todo integration

4. **Future Testing Improvements**
   - Set up test framework for automated unit test execution

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE (Post-Review)

**Date**: 2026-01-19 (Post-Testing Review)

### Issue Discovered

During final review, a **critical testing gap** was identified:

**Missing Test Phase**: End-to-End Installation & Launch Test

### What Was NOT Tested

❌ **Installation from Local Registry**
- Installing pepper-harness components from the dev branch's `dist/` directory
- Verifying the registry is correctly formatted and discoverable
- Confirming all 40 components can be installed

❌ **Live Ghost Session**
- Launching Ghost OpenCode with the new components
- Testing `/pepper-init` command in a live session
- Testing `/pepper-status` command in a live session
- Verifying pepper_notepad_add works

❌ **Agent Prompt Loading**
- Confirming agent prompts load correctly in OpenCode
- Verifying workflow handoff messages appear in UI
- Testing agent switching (TAB completion)
- Confirming RFC compliance protocol works in Habanero reviews

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Build broken at runtime | HIGH | Users get broken components |
| Registry malformed | HIGH | Components not installable |
| Component metadata incorrect | MEDIUM | Features don't work |
| Agent prompts don't load | MEDIUM | Workflow improvements invisible |
| Tools fail in live session | HIGH | Core functionality broken |

### Revised Recommendation

## 🔴 **NOT READY TO MERGE**

**Reason**: Critical testing phase missing

**Required Before Merge**:
1. ✅ Add Phase 8: End-to-End Installation & Launch Test to plan
2. ⏳ Execute E2E test protocol (documented in learnings notepad)
3. ⏳ Fix any issues discovered
4. ⏳ Update test report with E2E results
5. ⏳ Re-evaluate merge readiness

### Test Statistics (Updated)

- **Total Test Phases**: 8 (was 7)
- **Completed Phases**: 7/8 (88%)
- **Blocking Phase**: Phase 8 (E2E Installation & Launch)
- **Individual Tests Passed**: 18/18 (100%)
- **Overall Readiness**: 🔴 **INCOMPLETE**

### Lessons Learned

**For Future Development**: 
- ALL branch testing MUST include end-to-end installation and launch verification
- Code-level testing is necessary but NOT sufficient
- Registry and runtime testing is CRITICAL before merge
- This gap could have resulted in shipping broken components to production

**Action Taken**:
- Documented E2E testing protocol in learnings notepad
- Added blocker issue to prevent premature merge
- Updated all future testing plans to include mandatory E2E phase

---

**Report Status**: REVISED - Testing Incomplete  
**Merge Status**: 🔴 BLOCKED - E2E Testing Required  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-19 21:29
