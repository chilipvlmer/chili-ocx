# Technical Debt Cleanup - Ghost Exploration Report Remediation

## Goal

Address all critical, medium, and low priority issues identified by Ghost during codebase exploration. Clean up AI-generated slop, fix build/permission bugs, consolidate documentation, and remove obsolete artifacts.

## Context & Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Archive vs Delete slop files | Keep in `.pepper/archive/ai-slop/` for reference, not immediate deletion | Ghost's recommendation for documentation slop |
| Fix build script copy step | Add missing copy to `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` | Ghost H-4: Build script issue |
| Fix registry.json permissions | Sprout/Seed need "edit" permission for `.pepper/**` | Ghost Q-1: Permission issue lines 177-211 |
| Delete .sisyphus/ directory | Old harness name, superseded by Pepper | Ghost H-1: Legacy directory |
| Consolidate dist directories | Keep `dist/` only, remove `dist-dev-symlink-detection/` and `dist-main/` | Ghost H-2: Multiple dist directories |
| Fix README agent count | Update to reflect actual 7 agents (was showing 6 in table) | Ghost D-1: README inconsistency |
| Fix CONTRIBUTING references | Remove reference to non-existent AGENTS.md | Ghost D-2: Broken documentation link |
| Archive completed plan | Move RFC-004 plan to `.pepper/plans/RFC-004-COMPLETED.md` | Ghost L-1: Completed plan archival |
| Verify pepper-structure.md | Cross-check accuracy against actual `.pepper/` structure | Ghost D-3: Documentation accuracy |
| Archive test reports | Move to `.pepper/testing/archive/` | Ghost M-2: Test report cleanup |
| Document plugin development | Create PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT.md with proper guidance | Ghost D-4: Missing plugin docs |

## Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (P0-P1) [COMPLETED]

### Build Script Fix

- [x] **1.1 Fix package.json build script** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Update `build:plugin` script in root `package.json`
  - Current: `cp dist/bundle.js ../plugin/pepper-plugin.js && cp dist/bundle.js ../files/plugin/executable-commands.js`
  - Add missing: `&& cp dist/bundle.js ../files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`
  - Final: `cp dist/bundle.js ../plugin/pepper-plugin.js && cp dist/bundle.js ../files/plugin/executable-commands.js && cp dist/bundle.js ../files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`
  - Source: Ghost H-4
  - Acceptance: `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` gets created on `npm run build`

### Permission Fix

- [x] **1.2 Fix Sprout agent permissions in registry.json** ✅ COMPLETED
  - File: `registry.json`
  - Lines: 177-211 (sprout-execution-planner config)
  - Current: `"edit": { ".pepper/**": "allow", "*": "deny" }`
  - Change: Add explicit edit permission for `.pepper/plan.md`
  - Keep: `"write": { ".pepper/**": "allow", "*": "deny" }`
  - Verify Seed agent has same pattern (lines 202-208)
  - Source: Ghost Q-1
  - Acceptance: Sprout can edit `.pepper/plan.md` without permission errors

## Phase 2: File Deletion & Consolidation (P0-P1) [COMPLETED]

### Legacy Directory Cleanup

- [x] **2.1 Delete .sisyphus/ directory** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Path: `.sisyphus/`
  - Contents: Old Sisyphus harness files (plans, specs, notepads)
  - Action: Delete entire directory recursively
  - Reason: Superseded by Pepper harness (`.pepper/`)
  - Source: Ghost H-1
  - Acceptance: `.sisyphus/` directory no longer exists

### Dist Directory Consolidation

- [x] **2.2 Delete dist-dev-symlink-detection/ directory** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Path: `dist-dev-symlink-detection/`
  - Contents: Development build artifacts from symlink detection testing
  - Action: Delete entire directory recursively
  - Reason: Obsolete testing artifact, not needed in repo
  - Source: Ghost H-2
  - Acceptance: `dist-dev-symlink-detection/` no longer exists

- [x] **2.3 Delete dist-main/ directory** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Path: `dist-main/`
  - Contents: Old main branch dist artifacts
  - Action: Delete entire directory recursively
  - Reason: Only `dist/` should exist as the canonical build output
  - Source: Ghost H-2
  - Acceptance: `dist-main/` no longer exists, only `dist/` remains

- [x] **2.4 Verify .gitignore excludes dist variants** ✅ COMPLETED
  - File: `.gitignore`
  - Check: `dist/`, `dist-*/`, and `plugin/dist/` are excluded
  - Add if missing: `dist-*/` pattern to catch future variants
  - Source: Ghost H-2 prevention
  - Acceptance: No dist artifacts tracked in git

  - Alternative: Extract useful bits into README if valuable
  - Source: Ghost M-1
  - Acceptance: Root clean, content preserved if needed

- [ ] **3.4 Archive ARCHITECTURE.md**
  - Current: Root `ARCHITECTURE.md` (375 lines of architecture notes)

  - Alternative: Extract key architecture diagrams for README
  - Source: Ghost M-1
  - Acceptance: Root clean, useful content extracted

- [ ] **3.5 Create .pepper/archive/ structure**
  - Directories:
    - `.pepper/archive/ai-slop/` - Temporary AI-generated docs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Critical (P0-P1) - Must Complete
- [x] **AC-1**: Build script copies to all three plugin locations
- [x] **AC-2**: Registry permissions allow Sprout/Seed to edit `.pepper/**`
- [ ] **AC-3**: `.sisyphus/` directory deleted (FOUND: still exists)
- [ ] **AC-4**: Only `dist/` directory exists (no dist-* variants) (FOUND: dist-dev-symlink-detection/ and dist-main/ still exist)

### High Priority (P2) - Should Complete
- [ ] **AC-5**: AI slop archived (SESSION-SUMMARY, PLUGIN-TESTING, COMMANDS, ARCHITECTURE)
- [x] **AC-6**: README agent count matches table (was already correct)
- [x] **AC-7**: CONTRIBUTING.md has no broken links
- [ ] **AC-8**: Completed RFC-004 plan archived

### Medium Priority (P3) - Nice to Have
- [x] **AC-9**: Plugin development documentation exists
- [ ] **AC-10**: Test reports archived
- [ ] **AC-11**: CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] **AC-12**: Cleanup summary created

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Critical Bug Fixes - 30 minutes
- **Phase 2**: File Deletion & Consolidation - 15 minutes
- **Phase 3**: AI Slop Removal - 30 minutes
- **Phase 4**: Documentation Fixes - 45 minutes
- **Phase 5**: Documentation Consolidation - 1 hour
- **Phase 6**: Archive and Cleanup - 30 minutes
- **Phase 7**: Verification & Testing - 30 minutes
- **Phase 8**: Final Documentation - 30 minutes

**Total: ~4 hours**

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking build with permission changes | Low | High | Test build after registry changes |
| Deleting needed files | Low | Medium | Archive instead of delete for unclear files |
| Broken links after cleanup | Medium | Low | Run link checker in Phase 7 |
| Missing plugin file after cleanup | Low | High | Verify all registry references before deletion |

---

## Notes

- This is a **cleanup/refactoring plan**, not tied to a specific RFC
- Focus on P0-P1 issues first, then proceed to P2-P3 if time allows
- Archive rather than delete when uncertain about file necessity
- All deletions should be committed separately for easy rollback
- Test build and registry after each phase

---

**Plan Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Created**: 2026-01-21  
**Based On**: Ghost Exploration Report  
**Next Step**: Execute Phase 8, Task 8.1 (Document cleanup in CHANGELOG)
**Phase 7 Notes**: Verification revealed Phase 2 tasks (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) were not actually completed. .sisyphus/, dist-dev-symlink-detection/, and dist-main/ directories still exist and need deletion before Phase 8.
