Locate and read the RFC\n2. Find acceptance criteria section\n3. Verify each criterion\n4. Include RFC compliance in review output"

Plan-TODO Desync: Sprout creates plan.md, Jalapeño uses todowrite once, then both go stale\n2. Stale Todos: RFC-003 todos still showing \"completed\" while plan.md moved to \"no active plan\"\n3. Progress Invisible: Can't see PRD completion (3/5 RFCs done = 60%?) without manual counting\n4. No Ownership: Unclear which agent updates what, when\n\nROOT CAUSE: Missing workflow conventions for state management + no context-aware todo strategy\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:\n1.

Single Source of Truth: Use OpenCode todos as primary, derive plan.md from it (or vice versa)\n\n3. Lifecycle Protocol: Define who creates/updates/clears todos at each workflow stage\n   - Sprout: Creates execution todos from plan\n   - Jalapeño: Updates progress during implementation\n   - Habanero: Marks review complete\n   - Next agent: Clears old todos, writes new context-appropriate ones\n\n4. Ownership: Each agent responsible for maintaining their context's todos\n\nIMPLEMENTATION: Needs RFC to define todo conventions + update agent prompts with todo responsibilities\n\nPRIORITY: Medium-High (improves UX significantly but workarounds exist)"

Should each RFC get a feature branch (`feat/rfc-NNN-name`)?\n2. Or work directly on dev branch and merge to main when ready?\n3. When/how do we merge dev branches to main?\n4. What's the PR/review process?\n5. Are dev branches personal or shared?\n\n**Impact**:\n- Confusing for contributors\n- Plans include unnecessary steps if not actually needed\n- Unclear when to create branches vs commit directly\n\n**Proposed Solution**:\nDocument official git workflow in ARCHITECTURE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md:\n- Branch naming conventions\n- When to create branches vs commit directly\n- Merge strategy (squash, rebase, merge commits)\n- PR process (if any)\n- Dev branch vs feature branch usage\n\n**Recommendation for Now**:\nSince previous RFCs worked directly on dev branch without feature branches, and we're already on `dev-symlink-detection`, let's:\n1. Skip \"create feature branch\" step in plan\n2. Continue working on current `dev-symlink-detection` branch\n3.
