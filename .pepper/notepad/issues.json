This creates visual noise and disrupts the user experience.\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- Plugin logs should be written to `/tmp/chili-ocx-plugin.log` silently\n- No log output should appear in the OpenCode TUI\n- Logs should only be visible when explicitly checked (e.g., `tail -f /tmp/chili-ocx-plugin.log`)\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n- Log entries appear as overlays on the OpenCode TUI\n- Users can see real-time log writes during tool execution\n- Visual clutter interferes with normal TUI interaction\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis**:\n- Likely related to how OpenCode TUI captures/redirects stdout/stderr\n- Plugin may be writing to stdout/stderr in addition to log file\n- Or: Log file writes are triggering terminal refresh events\n- OpenCode TUI buffering/redraw issue\n\n**Impact**:\n- Purely visual - functionality works correctly\n- Confusing UX - users see \"behind the scenes\" logging\n- No data loss or corruption\n\n**Reproduction**:\n1. Launch OpenCode with pepper-harness profile\n2. Run any slash command (e.g., `/pepper-init`, `/status`)\n3. Observe log output appearing on TUI during execution\n\n**Environment**:\n- Platform: macOS (darwin)\n- OpenCode: v1.1.20\n- chili-ocx plugin: v0.1.0\n- Profile: pepper-harness\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Investigate plugin logging implementation (`plugin/src/utils/pepper-io.ts`)\n- Check if console.log/console.error are being used instead of pure file writes\n- Test with different OpenCode TUI versions\n- Consider using OpenCode's native logging API if available\n- Low priority - defer until after v1.1.0 release\n\n**Workaround**: \nNone needed - bug is cosmetic only."

If `git-mastery` is called with `.`, it might fail or behave unexpectedly if it tries to read `.` as a file.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement proper recursive directory scanning or use a glob library.\n- **Compliance**: RFC-007 requires \"Stage All\" support, which implies `git add .`. The current scan implementation might not scan recursively if `.` is passed.\n\n### 🟠 Major\n- **Location**: `plugin/src/skills/runner.ts:202`\n- **Issue**: `llm_generate` is a stub with heuristic fallback. This is acceptable for Phase 2 but should be clearly marked as a limitation.\n- **Suggestion**: Ensure the heuristic is robust enough for basic \"update file\" scenarios.\n\n### ✅ Positive Observations\n- Clean separation of concerns (Loader, Registry, Runner).\n- RFC-006 compliance for structure (Frontmatter parsing).\n- Fail-fast philosophy implemented.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nAPPROVE WITH CONDITIONS (Fix glob handling for safety scan).\n\nMoving to writing the verification script now."

RFC Compliance (RFC-007)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Verification\n\n- [ ] **Optional 'files' input (Stage All)**\n  - **Status**: ❌ Not Met\n  - **Gap**: `git-mastery.md` uses `${inputs.file}` unconditionally in `stage`, `diff`, and `check_secrets` steps.\n  - **Impact**: If `files` input is omitted, `runner.ts` resolves it to the literal string `\"${inputs.file}\"` (or undefined behavior), causing `git add` and `readFile` to fail.\n  - **Requirement**: Skill must handle missing input by defaulting to `.` or using a conditional step.\n\n- [ ] **Safety Check (Secret Scanning)**\n  - **Status**: ❌ Not Met (Ineffective)\n  - **Gap**: The regex `(?i)(api_key|secret|password|token|access_key).*?['\"][a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}['\"]` mandates quotes (`'\"`).\n  - **Impact**: Fails to detect standard `.env` secrets like `AWS_KEY=AKIA...` (no quotes). Also misses `AWS_KEY` keyword.\n  - **Requirement**: Update regex to support unquoted values and broader keywords.\n\n- [ ] **Diff Chunking (>10k chars)**\n  - **Status**: ⏳ Partial (Stubbed)\n  - **Gap**: `runner.ts` (lines 224-228) just truncates/replaces the message.\n  - **Requirement**: RFC specifies using `git diff --stat` and context windowing. The current stub is acceptable for Phase 2 but insufficient for \"Smart Tool\" designation.\n\n## 2. Code Quality & Correctness\n\n### `plugin/src/skills/runner.ts`\n\n- **🔴 Critical**: `regex_scan` (line 123) lacks proper glob support.\n  - It attempts `path.includes('*')` but logic for expansion is missing/basic.\n  - If `git-mastery` is fixed to pass `.` (Stage All), `readFile` will fail on a directory (`EISDIR`) because recursion is not implemented.\n\n- **🟠 Major**: `resolveVariables` (line 65) leaks implementation details.\n  - If a variable is missing, it returns the template string `\"${var}\"`. This causes confusing errors downstream (e.g., trying to open file named `\"${inputs.file}\"`).\n  - **Suggestion**: Throw error or return empty string/null for missing required variables.\n\n### `plugin/src/skills/loader.ts`\n\n- **✅ Positive**: Frontmatter parsing looks solid and simple.\n\n## 3. Verification Simulation\n\n### Safety Verification (Mental Model)\n- **Input**: File `secret.env` with `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`\n- **Regex**: `...['\"][a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}['\"]`\n- **Result**: **PASS (False Negative)**. The secret is NOT blocked because it lacks quotes. 🔴\n\n### Functionality Verification (Mental Model)\n- **Input**: No files (Stage All)\n- **Step `stage`**: `git add \"${inputs.file}\"`\n- **Result**: **FAIL**. `git` error: `pathspec '${inputs.file}' did not match any files`. 🔴\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\nPlease switch to **Jalapeño** to address the following:\n\n1.  **Fix `git-mastery.md`**:\n    - Handle optional `files` input (maybe default to `.` in the `inputs` definition if supported, or use a shell script wrapper that checks).\n    - **Better**: Update `runner.ts` to support default values for inputs in the Skill definition.\n2.  **Fix `runner.ts`**:\n    - Implement basic glob/recursive scan for `regex_scan` to support `.` (current directory).\n    - Improve `resolveVariables` to handle missing inputs gracefully.\n3.  **Harden Regex**:\n    - Update pattern to match `KEY=VALUE` format (no quotes).\n4.  **Verify**:\n    - Create the test script `plugin/src/verify_phase3.ts` as planned to prove the fixes work.\n"

Executive Summary\n\nThe current `git-mastery` skill implementation significantly diverges from the \"Best Practices\" identified in the user's research, primarily regarding **Safety** and **Human-in-the-Loop** protocols. While we have implemented \"Conventional Commits\" and \"Secret Scanning\", we completely lack the critical \"Confirmation\" and \"Verification\" steps that define a production-grade workflow.\n\n## 2. Gap Analysis\n\n| Feature | Research Best Practice | Current Implementation | Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Human Confirmation** | \"NEVER commit without user confirmation\". Strict permission model (`ask` vs `allow`). | Skill proceeds directly from `stage` -> `generate_msg` -> `commit`. No pause or confirmation. | 🔴 **CRITICAL FAIL** |\n| **Verification** | Run tests (`npm test`), linting, and type checks before committing. | Only runs `check_secrets`. No test execution. | 🔴 **FAIL** |\n| **Context Handling** | Optimize context windows; use stable workspaces; intelligent summarization. | `runner.ts` merely truncates diffs > 10k chars and falls back to a generic message. No intelligent summarization. | 🟠 **WEAK** |\n| **Worktree Isolation** | Use Git Worktrees to isolate agent context from user. | Skill operates in CWD. No native worktree support or checks. | 🟡 **GAP** |\n| **Conventional Commits** | Strict adherence to spec (feat, fix, etc.). | Implemented via System Prompt. | 🟢 **PASS** |\n| **Secret Scanning** | Scan for credentials. | Implemented via `regex_scan` step. | 🟢 **PASS** |\n\n## 3. Detailed Findings\n\n### 3.1 The \"Auto-Commit\" Danger\nThe research emphasizes that AI should *propose* actions, not unilaterally execute them, especially for state-changing operations like `git commit`. Our current `git-mastery.md` automates the commit immediately after message generation.\n- **Risk**: Agents committing hallucinations, broken code, or poor commit messages without user oversight.\n- **Fix**: Introduce a `confirmation` step type in `runner.ts` or split the skill into `git-stage-and-message` (returns proposal) and `git-commit-execute` (requires user trigger).\n\n### 3.2 Missing \"Verify\" Step\nThe \"Mastery\" skill implies high quality, but it creates a commit without running the project's verification suite.\n- **Risk**: Committing broken builds.\n- **Fix**: Add an optional `test_command` input to the skill, or a default `npm test` check step (configurable).\n\n### 3.3 Weak \"Smart Diff\"\nThe `runner.ts` heuristic for large diffs is too simple:\n```typescript\nif (prompt.length > 10000) {\n    message = \"feat: major update to \" + filename; // Crude fallback\n}\n```\nThe research suggests \"Intelligent summarization\" or using `git diff --stat` combined with partial file reads.\n\n## 4. Recommendations for Seed (Spec Updates)\n\n1.  **Update `RFC-007` & `git-mastery.md`**:\n    *   Add a **Human Confirmation** step.\n    *   Add a **Verification** step (run tests).\n    *   Split the \"Commit\" logic: The agent should generate the message and *ask* to commit, or the skill should pause for input.\n\n2.  **Update `RFC-006` (Runner)**:\n    *   Need to support a new step type: `confirmation` (pause for user input Y/N).\n    *   Need to improve the \"Smart Diff\" logic in `runLlmGenerateStep` to actually summarize rather than truncate.\n\n3.  **New Skill: `git-worktree-manager`**:\n    *   To address the Worktree recommendation, we should create a separate skill for managing isolation.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\nWe are building a \"Cowboy Coding\" agent, not a \"Master\" agent. We need to implement the safety brakes immediately.\n"

Executive Summary\n\nThe current implementation of the `git-mastery` skill and its runner (`RFC-006`/`RFC-007`) is **functionally unsafe** and non-compliant with the \"Best Practices\" outlined in the user's research.\n\nWhile we have achieved **Conventional Commits** and basic **Secret Scanning**, we have failed to implement the critical **Human-in-the-Loop** safety rails. The current skill acts as an \"Auto-Commit\" bot rather than an assistant, violating the core tenet: *\"NEVER commit without user confirmation.\"*\n\n## 2. Research Best Practices (Key Extractions)\n\nFrom `research the best skills for coding LLMs for GIT m.md`:\n\n1.  **Strict Permissions**: \"Permissions take precedence over prompts.\" Operations like `git commit`, `git push`, `git rebase` must default to `ask`.\n2.  **Atomic & Conventional**: Commits should be atomic and follow the Conventional Commits spec (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.).\n3.  **Verification First**: \"NEVER commit failing tests.\" Workflow: Change -> Test/Lint -> Commit.\n4.  **Context Management**: \"Long-running agents benefit from stable context.\" Usage of Git Worktrees to isolate agent work from the user's active branch.\n5.  **Smart Context**: For large diffs, use summarization (`git diff --stat`) rather than dumping raw text to prevent context window overflow or truncation.\n\n## 3. Gap Analysis\n\n| Feature | Requirement (Research) | Current Implementation | Severity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Human Confirmation** | Mandatory before destructive actions (`commit`). | **Missing**. Skill auto-executes `git commit` immediately after generating the message. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |\n| **Permission Bypass** | Shell commands must respect agent permissions. | **Vulnerable**. `SkillRunner` uses `child_process.exec` directly, effectively bypassing the agent's permission middleware. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |\n| **Verification** | Run tests/lint before commit. | **Missing**. Only checks for secrets. No `npm test` or lint step. | 🔴 **HIGH** |\n| **Worktrees** | Use separate worktrees for agents. | **Missing**. Skill operates in the Current Working Directory (CWD). | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |\n| **Diff Intelligence** | Summarize large diffs; don't truncate blindly. | **Weak**. `runner.ts` truncates at 10k chars and falls back to a generic message. | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |\n| **Secrets** | Scan for keys/tokens. | **Implemented**. `regex_scan` step exists and works. | 🟢 **PASS** |\n\n## 4. Technical Recommendations\n\n### 4.1 Immediate Safety Fixes (RFC-006/007 Update)\n\n1.  **Implement `confirmation` Step Type**:\n    *   Update `runner.ts` to support a `type: confirmation` step.\n    *   This step should pause execution and ask the user: \"Allow step 'commit' with command 'git commit -m ...'? [y/N]\".\n    *   If rejected, the skill aborts.\n\n2.  **Inject Permissions or Use Agent Tool**:\n    *   Instead of `child_process.exec`, the `SkillRunner` should ideally call the Agent's `bash` tool (if possible) or implement the same permission checks.\n    *   *Alternative*: The skill should only **stage and prepare** the message, then return it to the Agent. The **Agent** then calls `git commit` (triggering standard permission checks).\n\n### 4.2 Workflow Enhancements\n\n1.  **Add Verification Step**:\n    *   Add `npm test` (or a configurable `check_command`) to the `git-mastery` skill before the commit step.\n    *   Fail fast if tests fail.\n\n2.  **Improve Diff Handling**:\n    *   Update `runLlmGenerateStep` in `runner.ts`.\n    *   If diff > 10k chars, run `git diff --stat` and `git diff --name-only` to construct the prompt, rather than just truncating.\n\n### 4.3 New Skill: `git-worktree-agent`\n\n*   Create a new skill specifically for setting up the environment as per the \"Power User\" workflow:\n    *   Inputs: `feature_name`, `base_branch`.\n    *   Steps: `git worktree add ...`, `cp .opencode/ ...`.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe current `git-mastery` skill is a prototype that demonstrates *capability* but lacks *maturity*. We must shift from \"Automation at all costs\" to \"Assisted Execution with Safety.\"\n\n**Next Step**: Hand off to **Seed** to update `RFC-007-git-mastery-skill.md` with these safety requirements.\n"

RFC Compliance Check (RFC-007)\n\n**Status**: ⚠️ **Changes Requested**\n\nThe implementation in `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md` partially meets RFC-007 requirements but has critical gaps regarding default behaviors and input handling.\n\n| Criteria | Status | Implementation Gap |\n|----------|--------|-------------------|\n| **Inputs** | ❌ Mismatch | RFC specifies `files` (plural, optional). Implementation uses `inputs.file` (singular). |\n| **Stage Step** | ❌ Critical | RFC requires `git add .` if files omitted. Current `git add \"${inputs.file}\"` fails if input is empty. |\n| **Verify Clean** | ❌ Missing | RFC requires returning \"Clean - Nothing to commit\" if status is clean. Step missing. |\n| **Safety Check** | ✅ Met | Regex scan implemented correctly. |\n| **Smart Diff** | ⏳ Partial | RFC suggests `git diff --stat` for large diffs. Runner implements simple truncation. |\n| **Interactive** | ✅ Met | Confirmation flow implemented correctly. |\n\n## 2. Code Quality Review\n\n### `plugin/src/skills/runner.ts`\n\n**Summary**: Good implementation of the \"Fail Loud, Fail Fast\" philosophy. Security checks are present.\n\n**Issues**:\n- 🟠 **Variable Resolution**: `resolveVariables` returns empty string `''` for undefined inputs. This causes shell commands like `git add \"${inputs.file}\"` to become `git add \"\"` (invalid) instead of handling the optionality safely.\n  - **Suggestion**: Ensure shell steps handle empty variables or allow default values in variable syntax (e.g. `${inputs.file || .}`).\n- ⚪ **Diff Heuristic**: The logic to truncate large diffs (lines 310-314) is a hardcoded heuristic in the runner rather than a skill-configurable strategy. It meets the immediate need but deviates from the \"Smart Tool\" definition in the RFC which suggested using `git diff --stat`.\n\n### `plugin/src/verify-skills.ts`\n\n**Summary**: Solid verification of the **Runner** mechanics (security, interactive flow).\n\n**Observations**:\n- ✅ **Security Test**: Correctly verifies `rm -rf /` blocking.\n- ✅ **Interactive Test**: Correctly validates the halt/proposal/confirm loop.\n- ⚠️ **Scope**: This script tests the *Runner*, not the *Git Mastery Skill* itself. The actual `git-mastery.md` file is not exercised by this test suite.\n\n## 3. Recommendations\n\n### 🔴 Critical Fixes (Must Fix)\n\n1. **Update `git-mastery.md` for Optional Input**:\n   Change the `stage` step to handle missing input, complying with RFC \"Stage All\" default.\n   ```yaml\n   ## stage\n   type: shell\n   # Shell logic to handle empty input\n   command: if [ -z \"${inputs.file}\" ]; then git add .; else git add \"${inputs.file}\"; fi\n   ```\n\n2. **Fix Input Naming**:\n   Align `git-mastery.md` with RFC: change `inputs.file` to `inputs.files`.\n\n3. **Add \"Verify Clean\" Step**:\n   Add a step to check `git status` output before proceeding, as per RFC.\n\n### 🟡 Improvements\n\n1. **Enhance Runner Defaults**:\n   Consider updating `runner.ts` variable resolution to support defaults explicitly if not already robust, or rely on shell logic as suggested above.\n\n2. **Test the Skill**:\n   Create a test case that actually loads and runs `git-mastery.md` (mocking git commands) to verify the skill definition is parseable and logical.\n\n## 4. Final Verdict\n\n**⚠️ REQUEST CHANGES**\n\nPlease switch to **Jalapeño** to address the Critical Fixes in `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md` and `plugin/src/skills/runner.ts`. Once fixed, the skill will be ready for release.\n"

Loader Logic (`plugin/src/index.ts`):\n   - It DOES call `loadSkills` from `.opencode/skills`\n   - It DOES merge the tools: `Object.assign(tools, skillTools)`\n   - It DOES register them if found.\n\n3.

Skill File:\n   - `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md` exists and appears valid.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle issue:\n- The `plugin/src/index.ts` uses `ctx.directory` to find skills: `join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")`.\n- When running in the OCX environment, `ctx.directory` might be the root of the workspace.\n- The `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` file is the compiled bundle.\n\nWait, I need to check if the skill file is actually being picked up.\nI'll verify if `loadSkills` is actually finding the file.\nThe `loadSkills` function checks for `.md` files in the directory.\nThe file exists at `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md`.\n\nLet's double check the compiled bundle's `loadSkills` logic via grep or by reading the bundle more closely around the SkillRegistry usage.\nActually, I see `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` has `SkillRegistry`.\n\nHypothesis:\n1. The build might be stale? `grep` showed matches in `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`.\n2. The `loadSkills` path might be wrong relative to where the plugin runs.\n   - `plugin/src/index.ts`: `join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")`\n   - If `ctx.directory` is correct, it should work.\n\nLet's check if there are any logs or if I can verify what `ctx.directory` is.\nThe plugin logs to `/tmp/chili-ocx-plugin.log`.

In the log file reading I did earlier, I saw:\n  `[2026-01-25T19:19:36.807Z] 🌶️ chili-ocx plugin initializing...`\n  `[2026-01-25T19:19:36.808Z]   Context directory: /private/var/folders/d_/wh31y1w9375chrn4kyl3yzkc0000gn/T/ocx-ghost-4bd62c7f`\n  `[2026-01-25T19:19:36.808Z] 📋 Registered 3 custom tools`\n  \n  Wait!

This file is shared across sessions.\n  \n  The latest log entry is:\n  `[2026-01-25T19:19:36.808Z]   Context directory: /private/var/folders/d_/wh31y1w9375chrn4kyl3yzkc0000gn/T/ocx-ghost-4bd62c7f`\n  \n  My current directory is `...51e053fb`.\n  \n  It seems the plugin hasn't initialized for THIS session yet, or at least it hasn't logged to this file for this session.\n  \n  OR, the plugin is loaded ONCE by the host process and reused? No, usually it's per session or per start.\n  \n  If the plugin initialized successfully, it should have logged the directory.\n  \n  Wait, I see an issue in `loadSkills` in the bundle:\n  ```js\n  async function loadSkills(dir) {\n    try {\n      const stats = await stat2(dir);\n      if (!stats.isDirectory())\n        return [];\n      // ...\n    } catch (error) {\n      return [];\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  It swallows errors.\n  \n  But my main suspicion is the path.\n  If I am running in `...51e053fb`, and I have `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md`, it should work.\n  \n  Why did the log show `4bd62c7f`?

The plugin should run `loadSkills`.\n  2. It should find `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md`.\n  3. It should register `skill_git_mastery`.\n  \n  Why isn't it?\n  \n  Hypothesis: The plugin code is checking `ctx.directory`.\n  If the plugin is running in a context where `ctx.directory` is NOT the workspace root where `.opencode` is, it fails.\n  But usually `ctx.directory` IS the workspace root.\n  \n  Let's verify the file existence again to be 100% sure.\n  I did `glob **` and saw `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md`.\n  \n  Is it possible `ctx.directory` is a symlink and `stat` fails?\n  The `loadSkills` uses `stat(dir)`.\n  \n  In the `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`:\n  ```js\n  import { readFile as readFile2, readdir as readdir2, stat as stat2 } from \"fs/promises\";\n  // ...\n  async function loadSkills(dir) {\n    try {\n      const stats = await stat2(dir); // <--- THIS MIGHT FAIL?\n  ```\n  \n  If `dir` is `.../.opencode/skills`, and `.opencode` exists, it should work.\n  \n  Let's look at `plugin/src/index.ts` again.\n  ```typescript\n  const skillsDirs = [\n      join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")\n  ];\n  ```\n  \n  If `ctx.directory` is the symlink `/tmp/ocx-ghost-...`, and `fs.stat` works on symlinks (it follows them by default), it should be fine.\n  \n  However, in the logs, I saw:\n  `[2026-01-25T19:19:36.808Z] 📋 Registered 3 custom tools`\n  \n  This means it found 0 skills.\n  \n  Let's manually try to stat the directory using the shell to see if it's accessible.\n"

      "content": "Root Cause Confirmed:\n\n1. **Missing Registration in registry.json**: The `git-mastery` skill is NOT listed in `registry.json`.\n   - While the `pepper-plugin` has logic to dynamically load skills from `.opencode/skills`, the OCX system might need components to be declared in `registry.json` to be exposed to the user/agents initially, or at least to be considered part of the \"package\".\n   - HOWEVER, `pepper-plugin` logic:\n     ```typescript\n     const skillsDirs = [ join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\") ];\n     // ...\n     allSkills.forEach(skill => registry.register(skill));\n     const skillTools = registry.getTools();\n     Object.assign(tools, skillTools);\n     ```\n     This means `pepper-plugin` *extends* its own tools with the skills found.\n     So the tools should appear as `skill_git_mastery`.\n\n2. **Log discrepancy**:\n   - The log shows `Registered 3 custom tools`.\n   - These 3 tools are: `pepper_init`, `pepper_status`, `pepper_notepad_add`.\n   - This proves that `loadSkills` returned 0 skills or failed to register them.\n\n3. **Symlink / Path Issue**:\n   - Log says: `Context directory: .../ocx-ghost-51e053fb` (Matches my CWD).\n   - But `loadSkills` found nothing.\n   - Code: `join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")`\n   - Path: `/private/var/folders/d_/wh31y1w9375chrn4kyl3yzkc0000gn/T/ocx-ghost-51e053fb/.opencode/skills`\n   - File exists: `git-mastery.md` (Verified with glob).\n   \n   Why did `stat` or `readdir` fail?\n   \n   In `pepper-plugin.js` (bundle):\n   ```js\n   async function loadSkills(dir) {\n     try {\n       const stats = await stat2(dir);\n       // ...\n     } catch (error) {\n       return []; // <--- Swallows error silently!\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   If `ctx.directory` is a symlink, and `stat2` (fs.stat) follows it, it works.\n   However, if there is a permission issue or a path mismatch, it fails silently.\n\n   Wait!

No.\n   \n   Is it possible the `pepper-plugin.js` I am reading IS NOT the one being executed?\n   - `dist/index.json` points to `plugin/pepper-plugin.js`.\n   - `package.json` copies to `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`.\n   - I am reading `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`.\n   \n   Let's check `plugin/pepper-plugin.js` (the one in `plugin/` root, if it exists).\n   The `dist/index.json` says `files: [\"plugin/pepper-plugin.js\"]`.\n   This usually means relative to the package root.\n   \n   My file listing showed:\n   `plugin/pepper-plugin.js` (Wait, I read `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`)\n   \n   Let's check if `plugin/pepper-plugin.js` exists in the root.\n   `glob` showed:\n   `dist/index.json`\n   `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`\n   `.opencode/plugin/pepper-plugin.js`\n   \n   Wait. `dist/index.json`:\n   ```json\n   \"components\": [\n       {\n           \"name\": \"pepper-plugin\",\n           \"files\": [\"plugin/pepper-plugin.js\"]\n       }\n   ]\n   ```\n   \n   The path `plugin/pepper-plugin.js` in `registry.json` (or `dist/index.json`) refers to the location *inside the installed package* or the distribution.\n   \n   If I am debugging the source, I need to know where the runner looks.\n   \n   But here is the kicker:\n   The logs show `Registered 3 custom tools`.\n   It definitely RAN the code.\n   It definitely checked for skills.\n   It definitely found NONE.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n   Maybe the directory `.opencode/skills` is NOT in `ctx.directory`?\n   Maybe `ctx.directory` is not what I think it is?\n   \n   Logs: `Context directory: .../ocx-ghost-51e053fb`\n   My CWD: `.../ocx-ghost-51e053fb`\n   Files: `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md` exists.\n   \n   Is it possible `.opencode` is a symlink?\n   `ls -la .opencode`\n   \n   Is it possible `loadSkills` logic is flawed?\n   ```js\n   const skillsDirs = [ join4(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\") ];\n   ```\n   \n   If `join` creates a path, and `stat` checks it.\n   \n   Maybe `.opencode` does NOT exist in `ctx.directory`?\n   Wait, I see `.opencode` in my file listing.\n   \n   Could it be that the plugin is running in a sandbox where it can't see `.opencode`?\n   But it can see other files?\n   \n   **One critical detail:**\n   The `pepper-plugin.js` uses `fs/promises`.\n   \n   If `stat(dir)` fails, it returns `[]`.\n   \n   Let's try to REPRODUCE the failure using a small script.\n"

It logs absolute path.\n\n**Another possibility:**\nThe build is STALE.\nI checked `grep \"SkillRegistry\" files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` and it matched.\nSo the code IS there.\n\n**Wait.**\nIn `plugin/src/index.ts`:\n```typescript\n    const skillsDirs = [\n      join(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")\n    ];\n```\nIn `files/plugin/pepper-plugin.js` (bundle):\n```js\n    const skillsDirs = [\n      join4(ctx.directory, \".opencode/skills\")\n    ];\n```\nThis looks correct.\n\n**What if `.opencode` is NOT in `ctx.directory`?**\nIf I am running in a symlinked workspace.\n`ctx.directory` is `/private/var/.../T/ocx-ghost-51e053fb`.\nIs `.opencode` physically there?\n`ls -la` (via glob) showed `.opencode/skills/git-mastery.md`.\n\n**What if the plugin process has a different view of the filesystem?**\nUnlikely.\n\n**Let's check the logs for \"Scanning for skills in:\"**\nI searched the log file and DID NOT find it in the snippet I read.\nThe logs I read stopped at `[INFO] ✅ chili-ocx plugin loaded successfully`.\n\nWait!
