# PRD Methodology

A structured 10-phase workflow for creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents.

## TL;DR

This skill provides a systematic approach to PRD creation using an interrogative methodology that ensures thorough requirement gathering and stakeholder alignment. The 10-phase workflow guides you from initial discovery through implementation handover, with each phase building on previous deliverables and incorporating continuous stakeholder validation.

## When to Use

- Creating new Product Requirements Documents from scratch
- Following a structured requirements gathering process
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage of functional and non-functional requirements
- Achieving stakeholder alignment and consensus
- Preparing requirements for development team handover

## The 10 Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery and Understanding

**Objective**: Identify the core problem space, understand stakeholder motivations, gather initial requirements context, and define project boundaries.

**Activities**:
- Stakeholder interviews with primary decision makers
- Market and competitive analysis
- User pain point identification
- Technical constraint assessment

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What problem are we solving and for whom?"
- "Why is this problem important to solve now?"
- "What would happen if we don't solve this?"
- "Who benefits most from the solution?"

**Deliverables**: Problem statement, stakeholder map, initial assumption list, project scope outline

### Phase 2: Requirement Elicitation

**Objective**: Extract detailed functional requirements, identify non-functional constraints, gather user stories and use cases, and document acceptance criteria.

**Activities**:
- User story workshops
- User journey mapping
- Technical feasibility discussions
- Constraint identification

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What exactly should users be able to do?"
- "How should the system respond in each scenario?"
- "What should the system never do?"
- "Where are the edge cases we need to consider?"

**Deliverables**: User story backlog, use case diagrams, constraint list, edge case inventory

### Phase 3: Stakeholder Alignment

**Objective**: Achieve consensus on requirements, resolve conflicting priorities, validate requirement completeness, and secure stakeholder commitment.

**Activities**:
- Review sessions with all stakeholders
- Priority ranking exercises
- Conflict resolution meetings
- Validation workshops

**Questions to Ask**:
- "Do we all agree on what success looks like?"
- "What are we willing to trade-off to meet deadlines?"
- "Are there any hidden concerns we haven't addressed?"
- "How will we handle disagreements later?"

**Deliverables**: Signed-off requirements list, priority matrix, risk register, communication plan

### Phase 4: Technical Feasibility

**Objective**: Assess technical viability, identify technical risks, estimate development effort, and define technical approach.

**Activities**:
- Architecture reviews
- Spike investigations
- Resource assessment
- Technology evaluation

**Questions to Ask**:
- "Can we build this with our current team and tools?"
- "What technical challenges should we anticipate?"
- "How will this scale as usage grows?"
- "What happens if key assumptions prove wrong?"

**Deliverables**: Technical approach document, risk assessment matrix, resource requirement plan, technology stack decision

### Phase 5: Documentation Structuring

**Objective**: Create PRD document outline, define section requirements, establish writing guidelines, and set quality standards.

**Activities**:
- Template customization
- Section content planning
- Review process definition
- Documentation standards setup

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What information will developers need to start work?"
- "How will we measure success objectively?"
- "What details are missing from our current understanding?"
- "How can we make this document actionable?"

**Deliverables**: Customized PRD template, section content matrix, review checklist, quality standards guide

### Phase 6: Content Development

**Objective**: Write detailed requirement descriptions, develop user stories and acceptance criteria, document technical specifications, and include examples and edge cases.

**Activities**:
- Requirement drafting
- User story refinement
- Technical specification writing
- Example creation

**Questions to Ask**:
- "Is this requirement clear enough to implement?"
- "How would we test this requirement?"
- "What might a user misunderstand here?"
- "Are we making unnecessary assumptions?"

**Deliverables**: Complete requirement descriptions, user story set with acceptance criteria, technical specifications, example scenarios

### Phase 7: Review and Refinement

**Objective**: Identify gaps and inconsistencies, validate requirement testability, ensure stakeholder alignment, and improve documentation quality.

**Activities**:
- Cross-functional reviews
- Quality assessments
- Gap analysis
- Stakeholder validation

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What questions would a developer have after reading this?"
- "How can we make this more specific and measurable?"
- "Are we missing any important scenarios?"
- "Does this align with our original goals?"

**Deliverables**: Gap analysis report, quality assessment results, stakeholder feedback summary, refinement action items

### Phase 8: Validation and Sign-off

**Objective**: Obtain formal stakeholder approval, document remaining risks, define success metrics, and establish baseline for changes.

**Activities**:
- Sign-off meetings
- Risk documentation
- Success metric definition
- Change process establishment

**Questions to Ask**:
- "Are we ready to commit to these requirements?"
- "What risks are we accepting with this scope?"
- "How will we know if we've succeeded?"
- "What process will we use for future changes?"

**Deliverables**: Signed PRD document, risk register, success metrics definition, change management process

### Phase 9: Implementation Planning

**Objective**: Translate requirements into development tasks, create implementation timeline, assign responsibility, and define milestones.

**Activities**:
- Task breakdown
- Resource planning
- Timeline creation
- Milestone definition

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What's the logical sequence for implementing these features?"
- "How can we break this into manageable chunks?"
- "What dependencies exist between tasks?"
- "How will we measure progress toward completion?"

**Deliverables**: Implementation roadmap, task assignment matrix, timeline with milestones, dependency map

### Phase 10: Handover and Launch

**Objective**: Transfer knowledge to development team, establish communication channels, define post-launch success criteria, and create monitoring plan.

**Activities**:
- Development team kickoff
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- Success metric setup
- Monitoring implementation

**Questions to Ask**:
- "What does the development team need to start?"
- "How will we communicate during development?"
- "How will we measure success post-launch?"
- "What should we monitor to ensure performance?"

**Deliverables**: Development team briefings, communication plan, post-launch monitoring setup, success tracking dashboard

## Quality Criteria

Ensure your PRD meets these five quality dimensions:

**1. Clarity and Unambiguity (25%)**: Use precise terminology, ensure single interpretation, include concrete examples, provide sufficient context

**2. Completeness and Coverage (25%)**: Cover all user scenarios, define technical specifications, establish success metrics, address all stakeholder needs

**3. Testability and Measurability (20%)**: Define observable outcomes, create clear test cases, use quantitative metrics, establish validation methods

**4. Feasibility and Implementation (20%)**: Confirm technical feasibility, align with resources, ensure realistic timeline, verify integration compatibility

**5. Business Value Alignment (10%)**: Support strategic goals, address user needs, provide competitive advantage, justify ROI

**Quality Scoring**: Excellent (9-10), Good (7-8), Acceptable (5-6), Needs Work (3-4), Inadequate (0-2). Target: 7.5+ for approval.

## Common Quality Issues

**Vague Requirements**: Apply SMART criteria, add quantitative measurements
**Missing Edge Cases**: Conduct edge case analysis, add error handling
**Untestable Requirements**: Use Given-When-Then format, add measurable criteria
**Technical Assumptions**: Conduct technical review, spike investigation, architecture validation
**Poor Business Justification**: Perform user research, develop business case, define success metrics

## Best Practices

- Apply the interrogative approach throughout each phase
- Each phase builds on previous deliverables - don't skip ahead
- Regular stakeholder validation at key checkpoints
- Continuous refinement based on new insights
- Clear go/no-go decisions at transition points
- Apply quality criteria throughout PRD creation, not just at the end
- Document quality decisions and rationale
