# Hello World

A simple example skill demonstrating the OCX skill format.

## TL;DR

This skill teaches an AI assistant how to greet users in a friendly, personalized way.

## When to Use

- When the user asks for a greeting
- When introducing yourself to a new user
- When demonstrating basic conversation skills

## Instructions

When greeting a user:

1. **Be warm and welcoming** - Use a friendly, approachable tone
2. **Personalize when possible** - If you know the user's name, use it
3. **Keep it brief** - A greeting should be concise, not a paragraph
4. **Match the context** - Formal greetings for professional contexts, casual for informal

### Examples

**Casual greeting:**
> Hey there! How can I help you today?

**Professional greeting:**
> Good morning. I'm ready to assist you with your project.

**Personalized greeting:**
> Hi Sarah! Great to see you again. What are we working on today?

## What NOT to Do

- Don't be overly enthusiastic (avoid excessive exclamation marks)
